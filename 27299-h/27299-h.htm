			<p>Price $1 00.</p>

			<p class="ad-detail">As a History of the country this book is invaluable, inasmuch as it notices a great many events
			not mentioned by Bancroft, Hildreth, or Prescott. As a Novel it is unapproachable, for it contains
			several characters unknown to Cooper, Dickens, Marryatt, or Bulwer. As a Mythological
			Work it should be immediately secured, as it makes mention of a number of gods and deified
			worthies hitherto unknown to old Jupiter himself. As a Poem, its claims to consideration cannot
			be denied, as it comprises a great many beauties not discoverable in the &#8220;Song of Hiawatha,&#8221;
			besides several Indian names which were therein omitted.</p>

		<p>To state, that I think there&#8217;s a word to be said,</p>

		<p>In those noble charities, which are</p>

		<p class="i2">Without hoping a hundred-fold profit to make:</p>

		<p>I shall not describe the <strong class="special-emphasis">Spirit of Cant</strong>,</p>
		<p>Of popular humbug, and vulgar rant,</p>
		<p class="i2">And tell how he looks in a tangible form,</p>
		<p>And give the length of his horns and claws,</p>
		<p>The spread of his wings, the width of his jaws,</p>
		<p>And detail the other proportions grim,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19">&nbsp;</a>Which belong to a powerful demon like him.</p>
		<p>Go and look at the melodramatic stage,</p>
		<p>When a &#8220;spectacle&#8221; piece is all the rage;</p>
		<p class="i2">And there, in the midst of some &#8220;property&#8221; storm,</p>
		<p>While the sheet-iron thunder is rattling its best,</p>
		<p>And the rosin lightning, and all the rest</p>
		<p>Of the elements are, for some tragedy-reason,</p>
		<p>Making the &#8220;awfullest gale of the season&#8212;&#8221;</p>
		<p>See, at the sound of the prompter&#8217;s tap,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>The fiend come up through the &#8220;Vampyre trap;&#8221;</p>

		<p>The elfish grin, the tangled hair,</p>
		<p class="i2">The dragon wings and the scaly feet&#8212;</p>
		<p>And you&#8217;ll have a notion of him I mean,</p>
		<p>The demon of this, my opening scene.</p>
		<p>I might go to Milton, and steal, bit by bit,</p>
		<p class="i2">A description to suit my Spirit of Cant,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21">&nbsp;</a>A second-hand suit, but a &#8220;shplendid fit,&#8221;</p>
		<p class="i2">As a Jew would assure me&#8212;but then I sha&#8217;nt.</p>

		<p>Which love-lorn maidens on the stage</p>

		<p>She was costumed, no doubt, with the greatest propriety,</p>
		<p class="i2">In the very extreme of the reigning fashion.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>Well! she stopped to listen, a minute or more,</p>

		<p class="i2">Of an Astor Place car, and beckoned to him,</p>
		<p>And he followed at once, while his audience scattered;</p>
		<p>To tell the truth, he felt quite flattered,</p>
		<p class="i2">And he smiled a smile most heavy and grim,</p>
		<p>For he thought he&#8217;d awakened a tender passion</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28">&nbsp;</a>In the heart of a belle, a lady of fashion.</p>
		<p>And they sat side by side, this curious pair,</p>
		<p>While they rode up to Eighth street&#8212;and she paid the fare.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>They stepped from the car, and stood before,</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>To the Spirit, this speech was quite unexpected,</p>
		<p class="i2">And he stood in a sort of stupid dismay;</p>
		<p>And before his few scattered thoughts were collected,</p>
		<p class="i2">She rightly concluded&#8212;he&#8217;d Nothing to Say.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31">&nbsp;</a>Then she lifted her skirts with a masterly hand,</p>
		<p class="i2">And out of the puddles and ruts kept them well up,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Thus showed that she had the most perfect command</p>
		<p class="i2">Of the crinoline mysteries of her envelope,</p>

		<p>Then she turned to her friend with a nod and a smile,</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>And told him to follow&#8212;he straightway obeyed her.</p>
		<p>As they hurried along, she kept ever before him,</p>
		<p>And he kept his eye on the tempting prunella,</p>
		<p>Secretly hoping there&#8217;d come such a shower</p>
		<p class="i2">As would make a new Flood in half-an-hour&#8212;</p>
		<p>That she, with a womanly care for her bonnet,</p>
		<p class="i2">Which would &#8220;spot,&#8221; with the least drop of water upon it,</p>

		<p>But the shower didn&#8217;t come, and without a disaster,</p>
		<p class="i2">They reached the huge Library&#8212;christened of Astor.</p>
		<p>Then she shook down her skirts to their natural latitude&#8212;</p>
		<p class="i2">Ahem&#8217;d once or twice&#8212;struck <em>out</em> a nice attitude&#8212;</p>
		<p>And then she struck <em>into</em> this little oration,</p>

		<p class="i2">&#8220;Spirit, behold! these bending shelves</p>

		<p class="i2">Most welcome are the poor themselves</p>
		<p>To freely turn these countless pages,</p>
		<p>And gather from the words of sages</p>
		<p>All the light of former ages.</p>
		<p>Whoever wills is here a guest,</p>
		<p>The <em>poorest</em> are the welcomest.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>Who hath done this? your virtuous mob,</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>Here her Companion began to perceive</p>
		<p class="i2">That her feminine tongue would have its own way;</p>
		<p>That the cleverest thing <em>he</em> could do was to leave</p>
		<p class="i2">The talking to her, and have Nothing to Say.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38">&nbsp;</a>The lady had now been chattering so long,</p>
		<p class="i2">She felt that her voice was beginning to fail her;</p>
		<p>A punch would, she felt, be a blessing and boon,</p>
		<p class="i2">The &#8220;dientical&#8221; thing with which to regale her,</p>
		<p>So they pushed their way through the gathering throng,</p>
		<p class="i2">And hurried away to Taylor&#8217;s Saloon.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>They seated themselves at the table together,&#8212;</p>
		<p>The customers &#8220;staring their eyes out,&#8221; to see</p>
		<p>Who this queer-looking couple could possibly be,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Asking each other in whispers, whether,</p>
		<p>It wasn&#8217;t the likeliest thing that she,</p>
		<p>Was a Western Actress, and he an Editor;</p>
		<p>And some were terribly frightened, because</p>
		<p>They couldn&#8217;t help thinking there certainly was,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>The Old Nick to pay, and that he was their creditor.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>But the strangers composedly sat, never heeding</p>
		<p class="i2">These stupid remarks, or taking offence,</p>
		<p>And they quietly kept on their drinking and feeding,</p>
		<p class="i2">Without the slightest regard to expense.</p>
		<p>If an appetite sharp is a thing so delightful,</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>Charity had no occasion to sigh at hers;</p>
		<p>Boarding-house keepers would say it was frightful,</p>
		<p class="i2">And ruinous too, to the hotel proprietors.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>They were sated at last, and turned from the door;</p>
		<p class="i2">He, wondering whither she now would go&#8212;</p>
		<p>And well he might&#8212;in an instant more</p>
		<p class="i2">He was over shoes in the frozen snow;</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>While she coolly remarked, with a Camille cough,</p>
		<p>That the North Pole was only a half a mile off.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>How it was they got to their present location,</p>
		<p>I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know, and it&#8217;s not my vocation</p>

		<p class="i2">My heroes were there, near the frozen ocean.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>The man had too much of &#8220;cold without,&#8221;</p>
		<p class="i2">And the lady sighed for her tippet and muff;</p>
		<p>For though they had come by a summary route,</p>
		<p class="i2">The weather, they found, was wintry enough.</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>When  they  climbed  an  iceberg&#8217;s loftiest height,</p>
		<p>To the imminent danger of dresses and hoops,</p>
		<p>Of ribbons and pins, and laces and loops,</p>
		<p class="i2">The <strong class="special-emphasis">Grinnell Expedition</strong> was in sight.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>Now the lady had been prepared to preach,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>Or rather, to make a nice serious speech;</p>
		<p>But it might as well have been written in Dutch for her,</p>
		<p>For the wind and the weather, conspiring together,</p>
		<p>Turned out to be, altogether too much for her;</p>
		<p>One half she forgot, and she bungled the rest of it,</p>
		<p>Though I finally managed to pick out the best of it.</p>
		<p>She asked her companion, who stood in the lee of her,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48">&nbsp;</a>For the wind spread her skirts to the bigness of three of her,</p>
		<p>&#8220;Who sent these ships to the rescue of those,</p>
		<p>Who have perilled their lives in these Northern snows?</p>
		<p>Did he spring from the mob, the benevolent &#8216;masses,&#8217;</p>
		<p>Or from the detestable &#8216;upper classes&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
		<p>With a great deal more to the same effect,</p>
		<p class="i2">Which I couldn&#8217;t exactly make out the sense of,</p>
		<p>For I know that her sentences &#8220;failed to connect;&#8221;</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>And I suppose that her chattering teeth bit the ends off;</p>
		<p>But &#8217;twas very conclusive, whatever she said.</p>
		<p class="i2">He never disputed her; never said nay,</p>
		<p>But only hung down his discomfited head;</p>
		<p class="i2">And whatever he thought, he had Nothing to Say.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>Chilled to the heart with the terrible cold,</p>
		<p class="i2">Both to get back were most truly-solicitous,</p>
		<p>Never before was the saying old,</p>
		<p class="i2">&#8220;As cold as charity,&#8221; half so felicitous.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>They hastened back to Broadway, when she said,</p>
		<p class="i2">That one more journey that night she&#8217;d lead him,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51">&nbsp;</a>Before she&#8217;d let him go home to bed.</p>
		<p>And he, not caring to quibble or question,</p>
		<p>At once fell in with the lady&#8217;s suggestion,</p>
		<p class="i2">Not thinking she&#8217;d &#8220;one more&#8221; lecture to read him.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>This time they took a course rectilinear</p>
		<p>Southward, and landed in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
